# Compute-Edit-Distance

# Compute the edit distance between 2 strings. The edit distance between two strings is the minimum number of edit operations needed to transform one string into another. Here, an edit operation is the insertion, deletion, or substitution of a single symbol. For example, TGCATAT can be transformed into ATCCGAT with five edit operations, implying that the edit distance between these strings is at most 5.
